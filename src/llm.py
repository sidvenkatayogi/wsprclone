        Examples of non-edit commands (just dictation): "hello world", "this is a test", "I want to go to the store".
        
        Note: if the EDIT command seems to refer to an unspecifc sentence or part of the text, perform the edit on the Context/previous command, and then return the full current text with the new edited text. Still leave the rest of the text unchanged though.
        If it is an EDIT command, perform the edit on "Current Text" and return the RESULTING TEXT ONLY. Do not output any reasoning or explanation.
        
        If it is NOT an edit command (it's just new text to be typed), return exactly the string "NO_EDIT".
